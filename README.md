Introduction-to-Ruby-on-Rails
=============================

You’ve got a head full of ideas when it comes to creating a web app, but where do you start? In this weekend workshop, you’ll learn HTML, Rails, and GIT basics that will get you moving the right direction in your app development process. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming in Ruby - enough to play around with arrays, hashes, control structures, and methods. You will also be able to build and deploy a simple Rails app (Twitter clone) to Heroku.
