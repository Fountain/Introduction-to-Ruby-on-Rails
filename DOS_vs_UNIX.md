DOS vs UNIX commands

All Unix command are lowercase.

DOS		UNIX			Notes
Type	cat				– list out the contents of a file (text or binary)
More	more or less	– both work, ‘less’ is more powerful
Dir		ls				– use ‘ls –la’ to see all the attribs.
Copy	cp				– copy command
Find	grep			– very powerful.  Used a lot!  
Help	man
Cd		cd				– must have a space after the cd
Rem		#				– or sometimes a semicolon
Edit	pico or vi		– start with pico, easier to use.  Vi is more powerful.
Time	date			– used for time and date
Md		mkdir	
Del		rm				– use ‘rm –rf’ for dir.  Be careful, very powerful and permanent!
Move	mv
Sort	sort
Pkzip	gzip			– also use ‘tar’ in some places	
Pkunzip	gunzip

For windows machines: instead of http://0.0.0.0:3000 use localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000
